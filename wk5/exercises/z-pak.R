#' You've been sick for the last two weeks and can't take it any more. 
#' Finally, you decide to go to the doctor, who gives you a diagnosis of 
#' walking pneumonia. When you get home with your azithromycin 
#' prescription, you start wondering about the directions: take 
#' 500 mg as a single dose on Day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily 
#' on Days 2 through 5.

#' Explore this regimen using the following model:
#' 
#' - Model name: `azithro-fixed.mod`
#' - Model location: `model`
#' 
#' 

#' Simulate out to at least day 14 to see what is happening.
